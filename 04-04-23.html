            <p>I thought it would be a fun little project to make my ideas more tangible, by
                designing prototypes! It will force me to think even further about why things
                are as they are, and why I like certain things more than others.

                        <p>After creating my user flow, I started questioning every interaction I had to
                            make. I found that a dedicated window for the number of bags to buy was
                            unnecessary, and wanted to test if could include it in the scan window instead.
                        </p>

                        <p>As I don't design for a specific company, I had the chance to completely
                            design the elements to my preferences, including colors, white spaces, fonts,
                            positioning, shadows, edges, and buttons.</p>
