            <p>Before the terminology of UX design was even established, it has always been in Symbios with new technology - forcing new ways for users to interact with it. Sometimes it can be nice to just stop, take a moment and look back, and reflect on what progress has been made since the first days of computers.

                  I have collected some old interfaces that I have had the experience to use, and funny enough, I tought was incredible at the time!</p><br>

            
            <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/altavista.jpg" alt="" class="blogImg">
            <p>Ahh, AltaVista displayed in Netscape, the best search motor and browser back in 1999. I can see why. There are so manny buttons and choices to choose from in one convenient window. 
                  Notice the wording “Location” for the website. Just something i found interesting :)</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/doom.jpg" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The beginning of a new era, FPS games! (in this case DOOM). While the same information like ammo/health is still displayed in modern games, the GUI is all located outside the viewport of the game - is it an optimization decision or a UX decision? Maybe.</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/clippy.webp" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The notorious hero for Windows, Clippy! An early version of an onboarding process. I respect the risk and innovation Windows took with this approach, but I doubt Clippy has helped anyone other than being an annoyance.</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/Google!.png" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The classic Google front page. Not much has happened since the realese with its minimal design language and unnesesary steps for the user. In other words a succesful formula.</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/instagram.png" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The first version of Instagram. Another successful service like Google. They both haven't changed much since their release. Some minor features and graphics here and there, while still keeping their user's mental model.</p><br>
                  <p>Thats it for today!</p>
