            <p>Before the terminoligy of UX design was even established, it has always been in symbios with new technology - forcing new ways for users to interact with it.
            Sometimes it can be nice to just stop, take a moment and look back, and reflect on what progress that has been made since the first days of computers.</p><br>

            <p>
            I have colleted a number old interfaces that i have had the experience to use, and funny enough, tought was incredible at the time!</p>
            
            <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/altavista.jpg" alt="" class="blogImg">
            <p>Ahh, AltaVista displayed in Netscape, the best search motor and brawser back in 1999. I can seee why. There is so manny buttons and choices to choose from in one convinient window. <br>
            Notice the wording “Location” for the website. Just somthing i found intersting:)</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/doom.jpg" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The beginning of a new era, FPS games!(in this case DOOM). While the same information like ammo/health is still displayed in modern games, the GUI is all located outside the viewport of the game - is it an opimization decision or a UX decicion? Maybe both</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/clippy.webp" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The notorious hero for Windows, clippy! An early version to a onboarding precess. I respect the risk and innovation Windows took with this approch, but i doubt clippy has ever actually helped anyone other then being an annoyence</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/Google!.png" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The classic Google front page. Not much has happened since the realese with its minimal design language and unnesesary steps for the user. In other words a succesful formula.</p>
                  <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/instagram.png" alt="" class="blogImg">
                  <p>The first version of Instagram. Another sucesfull service like Google. They both havent changed much since their realses. Some minor feautures and graphics here and there, but still keepping their users mental model.</p><br>
                  <p>Thats it for today!</p>
