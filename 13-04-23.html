        <p></p>
        <br>
            <p>Today, it seems that all websites have tons of cookies and trackers that
                users need to accept to surf on their sites. As annoying as this may
                sound, under EU law, sites are required to disclose the embedded third-party
                cookies displayed on them. However, more often than not the approval process is
                confusing and bothersome, creating a big risk of losing the potential visitor
                for even using the site, and sometimes even hurting the brand. In this blog post, I will explore common mistakes I often see when browsing the web. What I
                like and don't like, and continue to explore by creating my very own consent
                prompt. (who knows, maybe I do a  full 180 and make it enjoyable?) <br><br>Usually, a
                user has a goal when visiting a site. It can be a link to a YouTube video, a
                cooking recipe your mother sent you via iMessage, or you might be searching for
                a new pair of pants. The point is, the user always has a goal in mind when
                visiting a site. That means that every second, every interaction the user does
                before they get access to the site has to be as seamles as possible. Therefore, I
                belive short and consistent is the key.<br>
                Let's start with a nightmare example of a consent
                prompt.<br>

            </p>
            <br>
              
                    <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/spotifyConsent.png" alt="" class="blogImg">

                    <p>This is a good example of the worst kinds of consent prompt out there. Funny enough, it is Spotify. While I understand that the purpose of it is law binding, and can get into trouble if they go crazy on the design. I can't help but feel there must be a better way. Something clear for the reader to understand (and hold up in court if it comes to that) while still having it connected to the rest of the website's design language.<br><br>
                        Users love when companies are transparent, so why not take advantage of it?
                     
                       A flaw of this design is that it requires the user to accept the terms without even knowing what website it consents to. Luckily, Spotify is a well-known company, but what if it wasn't? The wall of text is also something the majority of people won't even read, so why force it upon them? 
                       <br>
                        Another flaw is that the consent button is filled while the other is not. This is a way in UI design to help (or trick) users to navigate easier, as a way of holding their hand. In most cases, this is a positive thing, but I can't help but feel Spotify trying to trick me in this particular case. <br>
                    
                    </p> 
                   

                        <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/netflixConsent.png" alt="" class="blogImg">

                        <p>Netflix has a very different approach to this. While it keeps the same grey background and design language as Spotify, it has some good design decisions.
<br>
                            While still annoying (as it somewhat should). It lets the user scroll through the site with an option to interact with it, rather than forcefully take the user's attention. It provides enough information in text for the everyday user, while also having the decline button on the right side of the element. While subtle, it has a big impact on me, the user, making me feel like Netflix has my best interest in mind.
                           <br>
                            Another thing I noticed that many sites don't have, is the lack of language option. This is a fundamental flaw, as the users have no idea what they are to accept. 
                           <br>
                           <br>
                            With these do's and dont's in mind. I have gone and redesigned the Spotify consent prompt, this is the result! 
                            <br> 
                        </p>
                       
                            <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/consentProposal.png" alt="" class="blogImg">

                            <p>So this is the first iteration of it. It is enough eyecatching, you can still explore the web page, more in line with the design of the website, easy to dismiss or accept, while having the option to read more.  
                                <br>
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                
                                        <img src="./src/img/blog-cover/proposalSpotify.png" alt="" class="blogImg">
                                        This is how it looks in its context. I'm quite please with the result! While there are a bunch of way you can go about this, I think this is a realisticly approch (for the time beeing). 
                                        <br>
                                        The reason i focused on mobile in this blog, was that i actually dont have the problem with consent windows on desktops, thanks to the Safari extension Ghostly that automatically blocks it (in addition to advertisments). <br> 
                                        Oh and by the way, Spotify if you are reading this, you are welcome;)<br><br>
                                        <p>That's it for today, Kalo nj√´ t√´ mir√´!</p>
